title: SVG Trees from JSON with d3js

While looking for visualization libraries and techniques to illustrate documentation, I stumbled upon [d3js](http://www.d3js.org), and a world of possibilities appeared before my eyes.

My search criteria were:

* **javascript** - so that it could be included as a [user macro](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Writing+User+Macros) inside [Confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/)
* **plain text file** input - so that I could version the input in git and edit it with emacs
* **readability** of the diagram - to change from text spreadsheets that are representable by trees 

Most astonishing to me was how well the examples are documented: learning to use the library is a piece of cake thanks to those tutorials.

Hereunder are 2 galleries of examples:

* [@mbostock's blocks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)
* [d3 Gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#visual-index)

At work, I chose the [d3 Collapsible Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) to represent the combinations of criterias that define a user's profile, depending on what the website allows (ex: professional using iOS app to insert an ad). This collapsible feature allows narrowing down to a smaller set of information while doing a presentation.

On a personal side, I chose the [d3 Radial Reingold-Tilford Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550) to power my [About me](/dev/about_me) page, for I feel that all nodes are part of me and hiding some would make me feel like dishonest.

Other trees I looked at but didn't fit as well my needs are:

* [Reingold-Tilford Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550)
* [Cluster Dendogram](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063570)
* [Pedigree Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2966094)

The fun part is digging into all the algorithms that @mbostock uses!
