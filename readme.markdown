This is the source code for my blog isabellema.free.fr, it was forked from [Anup Jadhav's blog](http://anupjadhav.com), which was lovingly built using [Up](https://github.com/caarlos0/up) - a clean and beautiful [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Please run the following command line from root directory of project to test before releasing new posts:
```
jekyll serve --watch --baseurl=
